excerpt: "Creating a website with jQuery and APIs"
---

For our sixth lab, we had to create a website using jQuery and implementing two
different APIs into it. At first I wasn't really sure what I wanted to create, but
after searching through the public API list, I found a Kanye West quote API. I knew
that I wanted to use this one, but I wasn't sure what else to use with it. I thought
that I was going to use [Pixabay][pix] to get random scenery and have the quotes overlay
them, but I would only ever get 20 photos and they were not random so I decided to not use that.
My other idea was to use random images of animals with the quotes coming from the animals.
This is what I ended up doing. I created a site that has random photos of cats and dogs
with the quote as a caption. The user can toggle between cats and dogs.

For this lab we had to follow a tutorial on [Kahn Academy][kahn] to learn jQuery.
I thought that this tutorial was very helpful and I didn't need many other resources to
figure out how to do everything I needed to do. I did use the examples Dr. Goadrich
made in class with us to help me understand how all the parts worked together. The hardest
part of implementing the APIs was getting past the CORs errors. When using the APIs, I kept
getting a COR error and I tried a few different things to get around it, but nothing worked.
This was the main reason I switched from Pixabay. Although i switched from Pixabay, I was still getting
the errors. I was actually getting the errors because my API url call was actually
URT, and that doesn't work. Once I realized that all of the APIs worked for me. Once I found
that out, I went back to using Pixabay as my API, but I was only able to get a few non-random
photos so I decided to switch permanently. Once I got the APIs working, everything else was
just me formatting and adding scripts to the site.
