While setting up this blog, I had to use the terminal. I had previously used
the terminal, but it was kinda confusing to me still. I didn't know that I
could use the terminal to download so many things, I thought that it was only
for managing files on my computer. The hardest part for me was figuring out
how to install ruby. I didn't know i would also have to install [Homebrew][brew]
so that I could install ruby from the terminal. I am still kinda confused on how
to use the terminal, but I guess that just comes with more practice.

I am looking forward to:
- Adding a cool background image
- Adding nice fronts from [Google][font]
- Making posts that I can share my thoughts with
