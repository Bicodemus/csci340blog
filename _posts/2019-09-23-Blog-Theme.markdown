excerpt: "Updating my blog's theme!"
---

Finding a theme for my website wasn't too hard, I chose [Massively][massive]
because it seems sleek and I just liked the way it looked more than my other options.
Almost everything in implementing my theme is new to me. As I am writing this,
my blog still is in a very unpolished form. I am also learning how to add a photo in markdown.
This will be me trying to add a photo.

## I hope that this worked!

It did work, so I am happy about that. I struggled a lot with trying to integrate
Massively, but after meeting with my [professor][prof], I got it figured out enough to continue working,
but I still need to meet with him again because there are some things I am not understanding such as how
to properly edit the layouts, so that they look how I want. That part is also what I am
looking forward to the most, so that I am comfortable editing any part of my blog
and I can do it at any time.

Also while working on this blog, I chose to put my own background image, which looks pretty cool to me,
this is it ![background](/images/background.png)

This image is rather large! I didn't expect it to be this big on the post, but I 
am going to leave it this way, because one day i will have a large photo that I will
need to shrink, and it will show progress.
