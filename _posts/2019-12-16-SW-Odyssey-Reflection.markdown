excerpt: "My Odyssey Reflection"

One of the most valuable skills in working with our community partner is being
able to understand that different people will inevitably have a different understanding
of technology, and as well as how I can communicate my knowledge of of technology
to them. This skill allows me to be able to take in the requests of my community
partner and then be able to describe how I could complete the requests in a
language that we both understand. I grew up surrounded by technology I have had
to explain my understanding of technology to my family members all the time.
When I am at home, my grandmother will always ask my questions about her phone
and how it is working, and when I am away she will email me the same questions.
I used to have to help my grandfather with his computer, because he didn’t
care to learn any software newer than 1995. The experiences I had with my
grandparents and the technology in my life have helped me develop my skill
for communicating ideas about technology in a way that they would be able
to understand and in a way that is useful to them. This skill has been very
useful in working with out community partner, the Salvation Army. By
meeting with our community partner, I was able to see how much they
knew about websites, understand what they expected from the website,
and how their users plan to interact with the website. Being able to
understand the needs of each user in our website was essential in
designing the website, because we needed to make it simple enough
for anyone to use, but it still had to look nice and have working functionality.

The Salvation Army recruits volunteers so that they can raise money in order to help out each location’s individual community. The money they raise goes to getting gifts for those less fortunate as well as buying food for those who need it. Allowing the Salvation Army an easier way to recruit volunteers will let them generate more money so that they can give even more back to our community. This website is something that our local Salvation Army needs a lot, because currently all volunteers have to go into the headquarter to sign up to volunteer. The website will help not only the Salvation Army, but also the people around the county who would like to volunteer for the Red Kettle or the Angel Tree. The charity work that the Salvation Army does for our community is very much appreciated as it is important that even those who don't have much have a place that they can go where there are people who care. The workers at the Salvation Army seem very dedicated to their work and I think that our website will help them a lot in their mission.

This project has given my a great insight into how I can create a platform for myself. Previous to this project I had no web development experience and I had just gotten out of my second course of intro CS. This class was much tougher than I thought it would be, but in making our final project, it give me a greater way to use my voice as a platform. I can now create a website to look however I want it, and I can do almost anything I need to do with it. If this project has taught me one thing it is that there is never something that I can’t find helpful resources on, so if there is a part of my website I don't know about, this project has helped me develop skills in researching my problems. This project has also helped me develop my own voice in group settings. Working in a group of 6, including myself, it can be intimidating to speak my own opinion on how things work. This project forced me to voice my opinions on how things should be done because if I didn’t say what I wanted, then no one would know how to do it. Previous to this project, I liked working on my own and doing projects by myself, but working in this group on a project like this I realized that it just isn’t feasible to work on every project by myself. I actually enjoyed working with some of my partner, the ones who showed up anyways. Working with them gave me a greater appreciation for group work and aspects of a potential career path as a web developer.
