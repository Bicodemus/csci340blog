excerpt: "Our Third Client Meeting"

We recently had our third client meeting with the Salvation Army. I think that it went well,
they liked our website and gave us a few suggestions. As for future work on the website,
I have been first trying to get the website to run on my laptop because there are errors
I am running into with Visual Studio and dotNET. I am trying to get my group to convert
our dotNET framework version to the newest version, but I haven't made any progress with that.
I am also trying to figure out which tables to implement into our database, but the database
is a Microsoft Server SQL table, and it also has trouble running on my Mac. I am trying to convert
our group to SQLite, but no progress with that has been made either.
