In lab 5, we  my professor gave the class this scenario:

<blockquote>An auction website has items for sale that are provided by sellers. Each item has an opening price, a description, and an ending time. Customers submit bids. The highest, earliest bid submitted before the ending time is the winning bid and the item is sold to the bidder. Each seller must pay the auction company 5% of the winning bid. The auction company wants to be able to analyze the sales behavior of its customers and sellers and so must keep track of all bids and sales.</blockquote>

We had to first begin by creating an entity relationship diagram. This is mine.
