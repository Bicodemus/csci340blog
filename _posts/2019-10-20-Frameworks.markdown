In class we were separated into groups to test different frameworks so that we
could find one that we would want to use in our large Salvation Army groups.
There were 6 different frameworks that we investigated. They were Express, Ruby
on Rails, Django, Flask, ASP.NET, and Laravel. My group worked with Laravel, so
I wont be talking about it here.

[Express][exp] seemed like a decent choice. I know how to write in java, so I
think that it would be good to use because I wouldn't have to learn how to write
the code. Although using Java wouldn't be bad, I don't think i want to use this
framework.

[Ruby on Rails][ruby] is a frameworks based on the language Ruby. I don't have
any experience with Ruby, so I don't think this would be a frameworks I would
want to use initially. Although I don't know Ruby, the presentation given made
it seem that it was pretty easy to install and use. I think that this framework
would be a good choice for me to use.

[Django][dj] is a framework based Python. I know Python and I actually like it a
lot. Django seemed pretty easy to install. Since I already know Python, I think
this framework would be a good fit for me. Django also seemed to have a good
amount of extra features that can be incorporated and would be easy to use.

[Flask][flask] also uses Python. I don't like flask as much as I did Django, but
it seems like an okay option also. However there were a few other things that
flask uses such as Jinja and Werkzeug that I didn't really understand. I don't
think flask will be what i use.

[ASP.NET][asp] looked very interesting to me. It is based in C#, which I don't
have any experience with. However ASP has another program, Visual Studio, that
can be used along with it. Visual Studio would make using ASP much easier, and
it makes it a much more viable option for me. My group decided to use this framework.
