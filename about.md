## About Me

As of writing this I am a Junior at Hendrix College. My major is Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology. I am also hoping that I can get at least a minor in Computer
Science, but I will also try for a major if i can. The class I am creating this blog for
is my CSCI 340 class, Database and Web-systems. In this I am in a group with 5 other
people and we are working with our local Salvation Army to help them create a website
and database so that they can more efficiently recruit and dispatch volunteers.

## My Hobbies
I don't have many hobbies, as I like to stick to one thing and get pretty good at it,
and I will spend a lot of time trying to do so. I really enjoy playing video games
and my all time favorite one is League of Legends. I have spent [countless hours][lol] on it,
and I think of myself as pretty good at it, but no where near the top level. That is okay for me,
because mostly I just want to be better than my friends. I also really enjoy Rocket League,
which is basically car soccer. If you don't know what it is, I would recommend checking it out, just
to see what it is like. I can't think of any other games like it, and the skill ceiling is way to high
for me, but I want to spend more time on it so that I can get better.

Aside from video games, I don't have many real hobbies. However I do enjoy programming
as I see it like a puzzle. I don't really enjoy all of the web design that I have to do
however, because to me it seems much more like an art where you have to think about
how everything is going to mesh together to look nice.
